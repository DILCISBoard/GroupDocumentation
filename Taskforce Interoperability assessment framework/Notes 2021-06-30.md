* Janet Anderson

* Carl Wilson
* Phillip Tommerholt
* Luis Faria
* Gregor Zavrsnik

## Notes

* We discussed relationships in detail, and we decided to remove the relationships column and use relationship as a new dimension.
* Important note re. local implementations - these can be more but not less specific than the CITS, ie they can be more but not less restrictive.
* We have finalised this new table and we now need it to be tested in reality against a CITS - Carl is planning to do this for the CITS SIARD.
* We discussed the Open Document Format (ODF) and AIC.
* Stars might not be the best symbols - we are denoting complexity, and also how well things are described and detailed. How else do we denote this rating?
* Miguel is going to create a clean copy of our workings to send to Karin/the DILCIS Board/A2.
