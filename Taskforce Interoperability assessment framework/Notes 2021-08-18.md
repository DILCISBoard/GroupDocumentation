## Notes

* The issue is scope - what is up for assessment? **We need domain-level metadata. **
* 1 star is for basically doing nothing. Need basic amendments.
* What is 4 star for structure? These relationships are not defined. This has been discussed wrt AIPs. We should not allow this to be a free-for-all.
* For SIARD, the assessment up to 3 star was straightforward, but 4 star felt out of line. Metadata was the trickiest - again, this must be domain-level, and not CSIP general metadata. 4 star is relationships between metadata. Data was fairly straightforward - the rules were clear here - relationships were clearly defined - BLOBs etc. 1 star must refer to tweaks to the CSIP. Conclusions spelled out.
* More CITS to be evaluated, especially Archival Description CITS and ERMS CITS as these are very different from the SIARD CITS.
* Logical vs Physical package relationships - **package relationships _per se_ should be dealt with by CSIP.** This is like a RDF type issue.
* SIARD CITS should be 3 star for metadata as the SIARD specification itself defines the metadata to 3 star level.
* There should be a common method for all CITS to refer to METS structural elements (this came up wrt writing the CITS Geo and CITS SIARD). Then you could use a metaCITS (lego block of combined CITS) of e.g. ERMS, SIARD etc.
* Next steps: Carl to do a couple more CITS and check if any further refinements need to be made to the framework table before Miguel F returns on 30th August. Next meeting planned for after the All Staff meeting on Tuesday 31st August (perhaps we could use this to bring Miguel up to speed). Then weâ€™ll have a meeting (hopefully a final one) on Wednesday 8th September.
