## Notes

* Note we had a mini meeting on 31st August.
* Carl presented his assessment of the CITS SIARD and we discussed his recommendations:
    * You should fulfil the previous level in order to qualify for a level
    * Level 1 is basically no change so we should start at level 0 and go 0-3 instead of 1-4
    * Structure is difficult to deal with and package relationships could perhaps be dealt with in an extension of the discussion already in the CSIP?
