## **Notes**

### **Welcome**
Karin welcomed everyone to the meeting
### **Secretary of the meeting**
Janet Anderson
### **Members**
Audun Lund to leave SFA so will be leaving DILCIS Board. We thank him for his work and we wait to hear about a replacement person from SFA. We will also be inviting Arne-Kristian Groven to join us to help with the technical aspects of SIARD. \
### **E-ARK CSP updates (all)**
### **Common questions**
* Continuation of versioning numbers for the IPs (Karin). Everyone had read these issues on Github and were happy with them, but there were no suggestions for discussion (there are things needing discussion as CW has posed questions). 
### **Status of our specifications**
* CSIP
  * CSP folder for evidence, e.g. for digital signatures. Could we not put the digital signature directly in PREMIS? So we would not need to link to an external folder. This will be really useful for the eIDAS discussion papers with the BSI etc. Some kind of extension for a digital signature could useful e.g. in the PREMIS CITS. We need to be consistent across the CITS etc. Authentication processes guarantee authenticity, and digital signatures may not be the only way. Timestamping does not guarantee everything…
* SIP
* AIP
  * Splitting the packages – Anders Bo has started a document on this. OCFL would be the one to follow for versioning of physical packages. KB will send out documents on this.
  * We do not have a METS Profile for the AIP. CW would like everything to come from the METS Profile. The METS profile could contain validation information as well. It could include hierarchies. CITS ERMS does not have a METS Profile, there is an XML schema. CITS Geo has two METS Profiles. 
  * What is the time frame here? – users are wanting to see progress on the GitHub issues. For example minor changes could be made for all the specifications e.g. regarding package splitting. So we could fix a publication date for small updates, also the new cover sheets, maybe 17<sup>th</sup> May 2024 in time for the 29<sup>th</sup> May 2024 event in Brussels. 
* DIP
* Preservation
* Archival
* eHealth1
  * We have had a comments period for 3 months. The review guidance is in the agenda. We need to adapt the guidelines. The documents are ready – ABN and KB to check them (SS to give ABN access). Then DILCIS Board to review.
* eHealth2
* ERMS
* Geodata
  * Move to next meeting. 
* CITS SIARD
