### E-ARK3 project A2 M2.5 Presentation and discussion

The board has received the updated draft of M2.5.


#### Introduction

The M2.5 documentation has been updated in light of comments made at previous DILCIS Board meetings. Today’s meeting is to gauge the Board’s opinion regarding the current state of the document.


#### Discussion

The Board agreed to accept the content of Milestone 2.5. It was agreed that a minor addition would be made to the conclusions by KB regarding moving forward and ensuring a better link with EAG. It was noted that eArchiving has a relatively low profile at the EAG and discussion focused on mechanisms to mitigate this.


#### Result

The following Action points were agreed:



1. KB will add the above text to the M2.5 conclusions
2. KB will call a DILCIS Board meeting on May 26, 2021 regarding the levels of validation (KA is unable to attend so will provide written comments prior to the meeting).


## **Decision of Workplan:**

KB will update the conclusions of M2.5, at which point the document will be considered final and accepted.
