### E-ARK3 project A2 M2.5 Presentation and discussion

The board has received the draft of M2.5.


#### Introduction

Within the E-ARK3 project and Activity 2 there is a milestone 2.5 for suggesting a way with certification of the specifications developed within the DILCIS Board and the eARchving Building Block. Different options were presented.


#### Discussion

There was broad agreement for the general content of the document.

Questions focussed on which standards bodies to approach. European bodies such as ETSI were perceived to be more favourable compared to International bodies (ISO).

It was noted that there are complexities regarding the direct endorsement of standards by the EC. This may change with the publication of the Data Governance Act, although at this stage the Act is still a proposal and has not been ratified by the Member States.

Rather than approaching the EC directly the DILCIS Board would need to go through the EAG. EAG could be asked for a response to the Data Governance Act and the endorsement of E-ARK specifications.

It was also noted that the DILCIS Board have not registered a METS profile with the METS Board yet. This is still being worked on and updated, so is not in a position to be registered. It was also noted that when registered it will be “lost” (it receives a running number and is published on the Library of Congress webpage so will be detached from the other profiles). However, if the DILCIS Board decides to pursue certification it could face challenges if we have an unregistered METS profile.


#### Result

The following Action points were agreed:


    1.     KB and JK to do further research and add content to the document in the area of EC endorsements


    2.     KA, ABN and MF to follow up with the appropriate national standardization agency or similar body regarding the steps required to use ETSI as a standards body.


    3.     KB will create a Doodle poll for the next meeting which will be in two months’ time.

 


#### Additional notes

CITS Geospatial was briefly discussed. The discussion focused on the status of the engagement with the OGC – It was decided that the decision regarding how to interact with the OGC is on pause until answers are provided for a series of questions asked by the DILCIS Board.

Action points:


    1.       GZ to provide answers to the list of questions asked by the DILCIS Board.


## **Decision of Workplan:**

It was decided to focus on approaching European standardisation bodies such as ETSI. Initial approaches will be made through appropriate national standardization agencies or similar bodies regarding the steps required to use ETSI as a standards body.

Further research and add content will be added to the document regarding EC endorsements
