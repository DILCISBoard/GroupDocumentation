## **Notes:**


### Welcome

Karin Bredenberg welcomed everyone to the meeting. The Board sends a big congratulation to Gregor and the addition to the family!


### Secretary

SS will make the notes.


### E-ARK CSP



* There will be no bi-weekly meetings for the specifications; task members are asked to look into corresponding specification issues on Github [https://github.com/DILCISBoard](https://github.com/DILCISBoard) 


### Current status of our specifications



* CSIP: Enhancement of CSIP, METS version 2 out for comments, we will not leave METS version 1, avoided nested structure of file groups, descriptive and administrative metadata combined into one element, not rush into a new version, not possible to switch easily, METS 2 focused on newcomers; make easier to use, struct map optional; comments until end of February 2024.
* SIP: KEEPS is proposing two small changes which might affect also CSIP and AIP, text needed to explain how to implement it. Bunch of SIPs (schedule) it could happen that two SIP updates are ingested at the same time. [https://github.com/DILCISBoard/E-ARK-SIP/issues/110](https://github.com/DILCISBoard/E-ARK-SIP/issues/110) , [https://github.com/DILCISBoard/E-ARK-SIP/issues/6](https://github.com/DILCISBoard/E-ARK-SIP/issues/6) ; related: ingesting splitted AIPs with header AIP (or AIC); timestamp or "package creation date" can address that; AIP has "last modification date"; date related information; enough to know which package is the newest; AIP Update related, but is still a different issue. Folder structure: need to be more flexible regarding this principle?
* AIP: More investigation into OCFL needed [https://ocfl.io/](https://ocfl.io/) ; possibility to use it as manifest for packaged AIP; also for documenting. DNA splitted AIPs use case in E-ARK: METS pointer to other mets files; already in the CSIP
* DIP: no news
* eHealth1 (Stephen): no news
* eHealth2: no news.
* ERMS: First bug report in the ERMS XML-schema for the ERMS specification. Fixed!
* Geo-spatial: no news
* SIARD CITS: no news


### SIARD



* A request for changing the filename to make it possible for a more direct link in Linked Data has come from NARA. [https://github.com/DILCISBoard/SIARD/issues/58](https://github.com/DILCISBoard/SIARD/issues/58) 


### Webpage

DILCIS.eu minor updates, Joomla version 3 not going to be supported, migration to version 4 needed


### Next meeting

New meeting beginning of February.


### Meeting closes

KB thanked all for participating!
