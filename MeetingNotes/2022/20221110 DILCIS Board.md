### Welcome

Karin Bredenberg welcomed everyone to the meeting.


### Secretary

SS will make the notes.


### E-ARK CSP



* Decisions regarding DIP need to be agreed with Anders Bo, David Anderson will add Anders Bo to corresponding lists (required: CORE); Anders Bo can be involved in any work related to E-ARK.
* So far, in the DILCIS board no decisions have been made; the process for decisions still needs to be defined;  Github process in place, SIARD related specifications needs to be written in Markdown.
* Not many specification meetings. 


### Current status of our specifications



* __CSIP__: no issues (closing issues that have been fixed need to be done); only maintenance, need to have more examples and guidelines need to be enhanced; 
* __SIP__: no new issues raised; Incorrect cardinality (issue nr. 101 and 102 (duplicate)) - is one to many, should be one to one (agent, one name, not many names). SIP: Miguel Ferreira: Issues 96, 95, 92 - website issue/rendering issues; Miguel Ferreira: Issue of shallow IPs; large data amounts, 10 TB; referencing; Karin Bredenberg: violates the principles; Anders Bo: Can be tricky, must be investigated how to bring that into the CSIP; Karin Bredenberg: Not a CITS, should go into the guidelines. SIP Issue Nr. 6. Sven Schlarb: Issue should also be present in the AIP specification; need to Issue about supporting CITS updates. After ingest AIP needs to be updated. Metadata updates, adding a new file. AIP needs to be identified. Create a new AIP.
* __AIP__: Focus on PREMIS, starting in the guideline to give recommendations; OCFL is experimental, versioning; need to focus on actual practice in archives.
* __DIP__: pull request from August; update link to the OAIS magenta book; just a minor issues; further issues.
* __Teams__: maintenance, teams are not needed in the same way. Team leads one person in the DILCIS board. Anders Bo: Who should be members of the working groups needs to be clarified.
* __eHealth1__ (Stephen): more interest required, advertising, people are interested, especially in the packaging tool. It covers many eHealth systems, but lacking examples. updates in the guidelines are needed. JA meet with EU eHealth people at DLM, Stephen will be informed.
* __eHealth2__: putting data in the right spot.
* __ERMS__: National Archives of Sweden wrote user guidelines for CITS ERMS,
* Uptake of E-ARK specifications by vendors takes time (e.g. 5 years in Sweden, more in EU)
* __Geo-spatial__: Anita Graser will help Gregor with the specifications for geo data
* __SIARD CITS__: Some issues, but not many. A lot of demands on documentation.


### SIARD



* Only one third of issues are opened in Github, many questions are not related to the specifications, but to products; not clear how validation should be addressed. SQL2011 bi-temporal database, valid in a certain (validation time, registration time), data type PERIOD (in SQL). Typos, diagrams need to be updated, small things which need to be fixed.


### Webpage

Updates will be made when Karin’s agenda is a little less occupied. Next meeting


### Next meeting

New meeting proposed for 1<sup>st</sup> of December 2022 at 10.00.


### Meeting closes

KB thanked all for participating!
