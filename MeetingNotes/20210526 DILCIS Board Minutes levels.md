## **Agenda:**



1. Welcome. Secretary of the meeting
2. Levels of validation


## **Notes:**


### Secretary

Karin Bredenberg will make the notes.


### Levels of validation

The board started the discussion on the meetinging regarding M2.5. It needs to be possible to say how much validation that is offered for a specification.


#### Introduction

A change request has been sent to the Board.

**Change detail**: Deciding the levels of ‘validatiability’ for the CITS.

**Change impact in relation to DILCIS and E-ARK3**:

_Timeline_: This needs to be implemented by August 2021 (at the latest) in preparation for the release of the new and updated specifications.

_Criticality_: High.

_Risk_: The lack of knowledge about how much validation is mandated through the specifications makes it harder to adopt the specifications, therefore, these levels need to be decided.

_Cost_: The decision needs to be reflected in the correct procedures, in CSIP and the Guideline for CSIP, and text updates. This is estimated to require about 40 hours of work.

**Approval**:

Three levels are suggested, and this is the draft version that has been discussed:



*   A specification is used by many, and a request for endorsement is made. The CITS describing the use of the endorsed specification is focused just on how to place the content into a package following CSIP with no additions. Validation is focused on the package itself.
*   The CITS describes how to place the content into a package following CSIP with no additions in combination with a description of the format to use for the content. Validation consists of two parts, validation of the package itself and validation of the content following the content description.
*   The CITS thoroughly describes both the package with a description of all content and its files found in the package. The validation will validate both the content, the presence of all expected content and the content itself. 

The DILCIS Board needs to decide how we should move forward with the suggestions above, working with the refinement of the level descriptions, the decision of the use and then the implementation of the levels. Activity 3.3 needs to be involved in this work to support the DILCIS Board with their experience in validation.


#### Discussion

The Board discussed the change request and saw that it might need another name and the number of levels might be different. A smaller group will take on the work and suggest a list of requirements or levels and the name of the list as well as other content needed to be able to state the requirements for this matter. The group also discussed the aim with this task which KB explained as being able to give guidiance and clearly state this levels (current name).

#### Result

The following Action points were agreed:


1. JA will lead and be the note taker of the group with MF, CW and ABN as members
2. The group will need to finish the work by end of July to allow time for inclusion into the correct documents
3. The group will use the A2 team meeting on the 9th of June for a meeting
4. The group will give a first update to A2 at the all A2 meeting on the 16th of June
5. KB will incorporate the result in the Procedure for creation of a specification


## **Decision of Workplan:**

JA will take the lead and plan for a first meeting and then a first report from the group on the A2 meeting on the 16th of June.
