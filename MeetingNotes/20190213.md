Welcome!

From Ljubljana workshop: Explanation of why we have an AIP specification is needed. SIP and DIP specifications are seen as important. How to controlthat the sender is who the sender says? Answer to that is eDelivery and eID. Handling of signatures. Both last are sutible to explain in a guideline document.

We reviewed the roadmap and added information from specification view, but its not an easy task you never know when an update is needed, we need to listen carefully to our users!

Next meeting: Feb 20th.
