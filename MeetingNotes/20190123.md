Text:

Welcome to Maximilian Maede from Bundesarchive. MM introduces himself, he is working at German Federal Archives together with Sebastian Gleixner, he’s main topics are digital intermediate archive and metadata. 

Github issues – KB has added label “can be closed”, if you don’t want to close it please just mark it is closable. 

We are in the process with CW of setting up branches, but not touching the master branch. 

PT is double-checking that nobody has not marked can be closed yet in GH. PT will look through and mark issues he has recorded.  Everyone else should do similarly. We really need to start work with that! 

There will be no meetings next two weeks, it was decided to communicate via e-mail meanwhile.

Next meeting: Feb 13th.
